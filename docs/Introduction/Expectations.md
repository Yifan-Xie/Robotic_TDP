## Expectations
<br>
The robot teams are expected to complete a full football match with all rules followed and actions supported with behavioural reactions and impulsive response in the environment.

* Team 0 is expected to be a semi-smart team. It means that the players will make a minimal effort - enough to cooperate and compete, but not as effective as a high-performing team. <br>

* Team 1 is expected to have superior decision-making and strategy, and to have the advantage in both scoring and ball possession in a football match. <br>

Hence, our main expectation is that Team 1 will win each match and overperform all Team 0's strategies.
