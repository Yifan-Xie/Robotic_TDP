## Objective
<br>
The main objective is to generate appropriate solutions for the sub-problems stated above. Dividing the project into sub-modules allows us to interpret the solution as a bottom-up approach and facilitates assigning tasks to each team member. As stated earlier, the project outline is split into short-term sprints and long-term milestones. Hence, each sub-module is linked with a milestone and each sprint focuses on achieving a specific milestone.
