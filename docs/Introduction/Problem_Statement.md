## Problem Statement
<br>
The project focuses on designing with a team of collaborative robots that can compete with opponents in a simulated game. This problem was split into several sub-problems to be tackled one by one: 

* System Architecture - finding an optimal system design to represent and structure our execution flow. <br>

* Simulation + Visualization - implementing an efficient representation of the problem through simulation of the physical elements of the environment and visualising its different components appropriately. <br>

* Strategy and Decision Making - implementing from scratch the theory behind the strategy and decision-making on a team level.<br>
