# Supporting functions: Capture the ball: Ball soonest collision

## Supporting functions: Move to the main file

Supporting functions are mid-level function used by high-level planners that take strategic decisions for a specific robot or the whole team.
All logic inside this module can be seen as a library of functions that focus on interpreting the environment rather than providing strategic decisions.

Inside supporting functions, we can distinguish two groups:
 * ___Capture the ball___: set of functions to predict the ball movement without players interactions
 * ___Kick the ball___: set of functions to provide information on where the ball can be passed safely or if the goal can be scored. 


### Ball the soonest contact
The basic information about a freely moving ball (without any player in action range) is when and where the ball will hit the field side.
This information is essential for more complex logic like an estimation if any player can get to the ball before it gets to the field side.

### Assumptions, Inputs and Outputs
__Assumptions__: The ball is moving with uniform linear motion 

__Inputs__: Ball state, field size

__Output__: Time when the ball hits the field side

### Logic

If the ball velocity is zero: return infinity

Else: calculate the distance along the trajectory to the end of the field and divide by velocity
